      <description>Part of a team.I am part of Dr Dylan Child’s lab group. We don’t have a website yet because Dylan hasn’t got around to finishing it. But, from his webpage on the University of Sheffield he says: “I am particularly keen to understand how demographic, environmental and ecological processes interact to influence these processes. I also develop theory and methods for modelling and analysis of structured populations”. That’s pretty cool.</description>
