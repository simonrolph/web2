<h1 id="hi-im-simon-rolph">Hi, I’m Simon Rolph</h1>
<p>I’m a PhD student at the University of Sheffield. (That’s the main thing going on in my life at the moment).</p>
<p>I love wildlife and outdoorness; getting on my bike or going for long walks in the Peak District. But I also like coding, and steam trains. I’m a huge fan of botanical gardens and I have a terrible habit of taking lots of pictures of plants and never getting around to identifying them.</p>

<h3>So, what do I study?</h3>
<p>The patterns of growth, reproduction and death in organisms vary so wildly from species to species. Some species grow fast, reproduce vast numbers of offspring, and die young. Others take a slower pace, reproduce more considerately, and live to a ripe old age. Unfortunately, the diversity of life history strategies is not just a sliding scale from 0 to 1, ecology is never that simple. However, field scientists have collected data on the demography of hundreds of plants and animal species, these have been collated into the COMPADRE Plant Matrix Database and the COMADRE Plant Matrix Database.</p>
<p>My PhD is funded by the Leverhulme Centre for Advanced Biological Modelling which aims to harness cutting edge mathematical and computing skills to address major problems in biology. More PhD positions are available here. I’m affiliated with the University of Oxford through my supervisor Rob Salguero-Gómez and Salgo Team.</p>

<h3>Part of a team.</h3>
<p>I am part of Dr Dylan Child’s lab group. We don’t have a website yet because Dylan hasn’t got around to finishing it. But, from his webpage on the University of Sheffield he says: “I am particularly keen to understand how demographic, environmental and ecological processes interact to influence these processes. I also develop theory and methods for modelling and analysis of structured populations”. That’s pretty cool.</p>
<p>I’m a member of Salgo Team, the research group of Dr Rob Salguero-Gómez. The group’s ultimate goal is to develop an integrative academic research plan to use molecular, anatomic and physiological approaches to examine demographic aspects of an organism’ life cycle through a combination angles including field and lab work, as well as ecological modeling and comparative biology.</p>

<h3>Communicating science!</h3>
<p>I have a irrefularly updated youtube channel with such hits as “Life in a Jar” and “Cornish Wildflowers on Rosemullion Head”. Pretty thrilling.</p>
