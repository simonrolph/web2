<h1 id="hi-im-simon-rolph">Hi, I’m Simon Rolph</h1>
<p>I’m a PhD student at the University of Sheffield.</p>
<p>I love wildlife. I also like coding, and steam trains. I’m a huge fan of botanical gardens and I have a terrible habit of taking lots of pictures of plants and never getting around to identifying them.</p>

<p>Some species grow fast, reproduce vast numbers of offspring, and die young. Others take a slower pace, reproduce more considerately, and live to a ripe old age.</p>

<div class="col-sm-4">
<p>We have data on the demography of hundreds of plants and animal species, these have been collated into the COMPADRE Plant Matrix Database and the COMADRE Plant Matrix Database.</p>

<div class="col-sm-4">
<p>What can we use this data for?</p>

<p>I’m based at the University of Sheffield and I’m funded by the Leverhulme Centre for Advanced Biological Modelling (CABM). CABM aims to harness cutting edge mathematical and computing skills to address major problems in biology. Additionally, I’m affiliated with the University of Oxford through my supervisor Rob Salguero-Gómez (so I get free access the the botanical gardens!).</p>

<h3>Communicating science!</h3>
<p>I have a irregularly updated youtube channel with such hits as “Life in a Jar” and “Cornish Wildflowers on Rosemullion Head”. Pretty thrilling.</p>
