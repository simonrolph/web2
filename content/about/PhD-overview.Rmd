I am part of Dr Dylan Child's lab group. We don't have a website yet because Dylan hasn't got around to finishing it. But, from his webpage on the University of Sheffield he says: "I am particularly keen to understand how demographic, environmental and ecological processes interact to influence these processes. I also develop theory and methods for modelling and analysis of structured populations". That's pretty cool.

I'm a member of Salgo Team, the research group of Dr Rob Salguero-GÃ³mez. The group's ultimate goal is to develop an integrative academic research plan to use molecular, anatomic and physiological approaches to examine demographic aspects of an organism' life cycle through a combination angles including field and lab work, as well as ecological modeling and comparative biology.
