I'm based at the University of Sheffield and I'm funded by the Leverhulme Centre for Advanced Biological Modelling (CABM). CABM aims to harness cutting edge mathematical and computing skills to address major problems in biology. Additionally, I'm affiliated with the University of Oxford through my supervisor Rob Salguero-Gómez (so I get free access the the botanical gardens!).

### Supervisors



### Part of a team.

I am part of Dr Dylan Child's lab group. We don't have a website yet because Dylan hasn't got around to finishing it. But, from his webpage on the University of Sheffield he says: "I am particularly keen to understand how demographic, environmental and ecological processes interact to influence these processes. I also develop theory and methods for modelling and analysis of structured populations". That's pretty cool.

I'm a member of Salgo Team, the research group of Dr Rob Salguero-Gómez. The group's ultimate goal is to develop an integrative academic research plan to use molecular, anatomic and physiological approaches to examine demographic aspects of an organism' life cycle through a combination angles including field and lab work, as well as ecological modeling and comparative biology.
