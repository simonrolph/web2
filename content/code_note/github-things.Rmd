### Create a new repo from existing files

Assuming you've already set up your ssh stuff

```
git init
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin git@github.com:simonrolph/repo.git
git push -u origin master
```


### Creating and pushing to a gh-pages branch

```
git branch gh-pages
git push -u origin gh-pages
```

Go to https://github.com/username/repo/settings/ and change `gh-pages` to master branch


### Force pull

```
git fetch --all
```

Then, you have two options:

```
git reset --hard origin/master
```

OR If you are on some other branch:

```
git reset --hard origin/<branch_name>
```
